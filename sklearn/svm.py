# SVM
# kernel in machine learning are basically the degree of equation that we are taking to seperate 
# the different classes from each other. 
# In SVM's we draw hyper planes which are not planes in a 2-D surface but in higher dimensional 
# spaces they are called hyper planes. These basically try to seperate one class from all the other 
# points and these SVMs for all the points are drawn. So what we try to do is maximize the distance 
# between the SVMs and the line of seperation for the classes.

#  This is only a theory and no program is writen here
